4,32,What is the difference between counselling and college selection?,"Counselling and college selection are two different services and are conducted separately. A counselling session is a one-hour personalized session where you can discuss your profile with our expert counsellors. They will identify gaps and recommend a roadmap for the next few months to build or strengthen your profile. College selection sessions are conducted closer to application deadlines, once you have incorporated the counsellor's suggestions and have your test scores in hand. Your counsellor will then do an in-depth analysis of your profile and goals and end the session with a finite list of colleges.","two different services | ""conducted separately"" | ""counselling session"" | ""identify gaps"" | ""college selection session"" | ""list of colleges"""
4,33,I’m not interested in College Selection – just want to do apps:,"We strongly recommend a college selection session as this is the next logical step to help you get into the college of your choice.

4,36,Do colleges in the US require 16 years of education before you can apply to them?,"Some top schools accept 15 years of education for MBA, while others do not. It totally depends on the school.

If it is not explicitly stated, you should email the admissions coordinator at the business school for complete clarity.","some top schools accept 15 years | ""depends on school"" | ""check the website"" | ""email the admissions coordinator"""
4,37,"I am already working with my school counsellor on my profile and editing my apps, I’m not sure I need your services at this point","That's great to know! However, we have noticed that many students who initially work with school counsellors come to us for expert guidance closer to deadlines. School counsellors often lack the time or motivation to push students as hard as we do. Additionally, our counsellors have firsthand experience in the admissions process, having studied at top-ranked global schools.
